The project "Upscaling Ecosystem Resilience to Climate Change in a Mediterranean Ecosystem of Chile using Remote Sensing" will run from 2024-2027. Its objectives are: i) to assess the direct and indirect impacts of plant functional response diversity on ecosystem resilience via soil-atmosphere feedbacks; ii) to upscale plant functional response diversity, soil-atmosphere feedbacks and ecosystem resilience to a landscape scale by integrating field sampling and drone with satellite data; and iii) to assess the potential impacts of future plant functional response diversity and soil-atmosphere feedbacks on ecosystem resilience for a range of climate change scenarios.
