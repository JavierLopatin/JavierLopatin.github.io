The Center for Climate and Resilience Research (CR2) is a research center that brings together researchers from the social and natural sciences with the purpose of generating knowledge on climate science and resilience from an interdisciplinary approach, and to study how climate change impacts ecosystems and Chilean society.

CR2 was born in 2013 funded by the Priority Areas Program (Fondap) of the National Agency for Research and Development (Anid). It brings together researchers from Universidad de Chile (sponsoring institution), Universidad de Concepción and Universidad Austral de Chile (associated institutions), and other academic institutions throughout the country.

The first cycle of CR2, between 2013 and 2017, focused on understanding the climate system and its impacts on the country, strengthening the national scientific community, and contributing to climate change adaptation and mitigation measures. In its second cycle, from 2018 to 2023, CR2 adds the commitment to become a relevant actor at the national level to achieve sustainable development and reach the Chilean goal of decreasing carbon emissions according to the Paris Agreement.

During the period 2024-2025, CR2 seeks to expand its research to South America, including the Antarctic territory, with the objective of laying the groundwork for a future regional projection of the center's work.
