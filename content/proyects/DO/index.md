Data Observatory is the result of a public-private-academic collaboration, which seeks to maximize the benefits that can be obtained from data for science, research and productive development, through the creation, administration and enrichment of open data platforms that are available to the community for the generation of public policies and initiatives that have a social impact on issues related to climate change, logistics and transportation, mining, aquaculture, land management and natural disaster prevention, among others.
