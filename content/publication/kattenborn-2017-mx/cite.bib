 abstract = {Question Do spatial gradients of plant strategies correspond to
patterns of plant traits obtained from a physically based model
and hyperspectral imagery? It has been shown before that
reflectance can be used to map plant strategies according to the
established CSR scheme. So far, these approaches were based on
empirical links and lacked transferability. Therefore, we test
if physically-based derivations of plant traits may help in
finding gradients in traits that are linked to strategies.
Location A raised bog and minerotrophic fen complex, Murnauer
Moos, Germany. Methods Spatial distributions of plant traits
were modelled by adopting an inversion of the PROSAIL radiative
transfer model on airborne hyperspectral imagery. The traits are
derived from reflectance without making use of field data but
only of known links between reflectance and traits. We tested
whether previously found patterns in CSR plant strategies were
related to the modelled traits. Results The results confirm
close relationships between modelled plant traits and C, S and R
strategies that were previously found in the field. The modelled
plant traits explained different dimensions of the CSR-space.
Leaf Area Index (LAI) and the reciprocal of Specific Leaf Area
appeared to be good candidates for reproducing CSR scores as
community traits using remote sensing. LAI has not been used in
previous studies to allocate plant strategies. Conclusions
Combining RTMs and the CSR model is a promising approach for
establishing a robust link between airborne or spaceborne
imagery and plant functioning. The demonstrated potential to map
traits with close relation to CSR gradients using only our
understanding of the relation between traits and reflectance is
a step forward towards an operational use of the CSR model in
remote sensing. This article is protected by copyright. All
