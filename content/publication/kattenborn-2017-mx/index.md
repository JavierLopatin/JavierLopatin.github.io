abstract: Question Do spatial gradients of plant strategies correspond to patterns
  of plant traits obtained from a physically based model and hyperspectral imagery?
  It has been shown before that reflectance can be used to map plant strategies according
  to the established CSR scheme. So far, these approaches were based on empirical
  links and lacked transferability. Therefore, we test if physically-based derivations
  of plant traits may help in finding gradients in traits that are linked to strategies.
  Location A raised bog and minerotrophic fen complex, Murnauer Moos, Germany. Methods
  Spatial distributions of plant traits were modelled by adopting an inversion of
  the PROSAIL radiative transfer model on airborne hyperspectral imagery. The traits
  are derived from reflectance without making use of field data but only of known
  links between reflectance and traits. We tested whether previously found patterns
  in CSR plant strategies were related to the modelled traits. Results The results
  confirm close relationships between modelled plant traits and C, S and R strategies
  that were previously found in the field. The modelled plant traits explained different
  dimensions of the CSR-space. Leaf Area Index (LAI) and the reciprocal of Specific
  Leaf Area appeared to be good candidates for reproducing CSR scores as community
  traits using remote sensing. LAI has not been used in previous studies to allocate
  plant strategies. Conclusions Combining RTMs and the CSR model is a promising approach
  for establishing a robust link between airborne or spaceborne imagery and plant
  functioning. The demonstrated potential to map traits with close relation to CSR
  gradients using only our understanding of the relation between traits and reflectance
  is a step forward towards an operational use of the CSR model in remote sensing.
