 abstract = {A multistructural object-based LiDAR approach to predict plant
richness in complex structure forests is presented. A normalized
LiDAR point cloud was split into four height ranges: 1) high
canopies (points above 16 m); 2) middle-high canopies (8-16 m);
3) middle-low canopies (2-8 m); and 4) low canopies (0-2 m). A
digital canopy model (DCM) was obtained from the full normalized
LiDAR point cloud, and four pseudo-DCMs (pDCMs) were obtained
from the split point clouds. We applied a multiresolution
segmentation algorithm to the DCM and the four pDCMs to obtain
crown objects. A partial least squares path model (PLS-PM)
algorithm was applied to predict total vascular plant richness
using object-based image analysis (OBIA) variables, derived from
the delineated crown objects, and topographic variables, derived
from a digital terrain model. Results showed that the
object-based model was able to predict the total richness with an
r2 of 0.64 and a root-mean-square error of four species.
Topographic variables showed to be more important than the OBIA
variables to predict richness. Furthermore, high-medium canopies
(8-16 m) showed the biggest correlation with the total plant
richness within the structural segments of the forest.},
