abstract: The plant carotenoid (Car) content plays a crucial role in the xanthophyll
  cycle and provides essential information on the physiological adaptations of plants
  to environmental stress. Spectroscopy data are essential for the nondestructive
  prediction of Car and other traits. However, Car content estimation is still behind
  in terms of accuracy compared to other pigments, such as chlorophyll (Chl). Here,
  I examined the potential of using the continuous wavelet transform (CWT) on leaf
  reflectance data to create vegetation indices (VIs). I compared six CWT mother families
  and six scales and selected the best overall dataset using random forest (RF) regressions.
  Using a brute-force approach, I created wavelet-based VIs on the best mother family
  and compared them against established Car reflectance-based VIs. I found that wavelet-based
  indices have high linear sensitivity to the Car content, contrary to typical nonlinear
  relationships depicted by the reflectance-based VIs. These relations were theoretically
  contrasted with the synthetic data created using the PROSPECT-D radiative transfer
  model. However, the best selection of wavelength bands in wavelet-based VIs varies
  greatly depending on the spectral characteristics of the input data before the transformation.
