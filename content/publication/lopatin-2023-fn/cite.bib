 abstract = {The plant carotenoid (Car) content plays a crucial role in the
xanthophyll cycle and provides essential information on the
physiological adaptations of plants to environmental stress.
Spectroscopy data are essential for the nondestructive prediction
of Car and other traits. However, Car content estimation is still
behind in terms of accuracy compared to other pigments, such as
chlorophyll (Chl). Here, I examined the potential of using the
continuous wavelet transform (CWT) on leaf reflectance data to
create vegetation indices (VIs). I compared six CWT mother
families and six scales and selected the best overall dataset
using random forest (RF) regressions. Using a brute-force
approach, I created wavelet-based VIs on the best mother family
and compared them against established Car reflectance-based VIs.
I found that wavelet-based indices have high linear sensitivity
to the Car content, contrary to typical nonlinear relationships
depicted by the reflectance-based VIs. These relations were
theoretically contrasted with the synthetic data created using
the PROSPECT-D radiative transfer model. However, the best
selection of wavelength bands in wavelet-based VIs varies greatly
depending on the spectral characteristics of the input data
before the transformation.},
