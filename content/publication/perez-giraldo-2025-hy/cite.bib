 abstract = {Globally, mountains are highly diverse ecosystems that serve as
natural laboratories for testing fundamental ecological theories,
while also providing vital ecosystem services. The biodiversity
of these ecosystems is largely attributed to their complex
topography, which creates gradients of elevation and
environmental heterogeneity. These gradients in turn influence
the maintenance of ecosystem functions, such as vegetation
productivity, over time. However, how topography influences
ecosystem stability and its relation with different facets of
biodiversity in mountain ecosystems remains relatively
unexplored. Here, we evaluated the impacts of environmental
heterogeneity and spatial autocorrelation on taxonomic and
phylogenetic diversity, and the extent to which they mediate
ecosystem stability in a mountain ecosystem. Using a
highly-replicated fractal sampling design, we estimated plant
taxonomic and phylogenetic diversity locally and across space. We
estimated the temporal stability of vegetation productivity with
a high-resolution, remotely-sensed vegetation productivity time
series in the Mediterranean Andes forest of central Chile. We
assessed the effects of topographic gradients as proxies for
environmental heterogeneity and local phylogenetic and taxonomic
diversity and turnover on ecosystem stability using generalized
linear and structural equation models that account for spatial
autocorrelation. Our results show that environmental
heterogeneity, particularly that associated with topographic
ruggedness and elevation, plays a key role in shaping plant
diversity and ecosystem stability. While increasing topographic
ruggedness and elevation increased taxonomic turnover, structural
equation modeling indicated that it decreased taxonomic and
