 abstract = {Excessive tree mortality is a global concern and remains poorly
understood as it is a complex phenomenon. We lack global and
temporally continuous coverage on tree mortality data.
Ground-based observations on tree mortality, e.g., derived from
national inventories, are very sparse, not standardized and not
spatially explicit. Earth observation data, combined with
supervised machine learning, offer a promising approach to map
tree mortality over time. However, global-scale machine learning
requires broad training data covering a wide range of
environmental settings and forest types. Drones provide a
cost-effective source of training data by capturing
high-resolution orthophotos of tree mortality events at
sub-centimeter resolution. Here, we introduce deadtrees.earth, an
open-access platform hosting more than a thousand
centimeter-resolution orthophotos, covering already more than
300,000 ha, of which more than 58,000 ha are fully annotated. This
community-sourced and rigorously curated dataset shall serve as a
foundation for a global initiative to gather comprehensive
reference data. In concert with Earth observation data and machine
learning it will serve to uncover tree mortality patterns from
local to global scales. This will provide the foundation to
attribute tree mortality patterns to environmental changes or
project tree mortality dynamics to the future. Thus, the open and
interactive nature of deadtrees.earth together with the collective
effort of the community is meant to continuously increase our
capacity to uncover and understand tree mortality patterns.},
