abstract: Excessive tree mortality is a global concern and remains poorly understood
  as it is a complex phenomenon. We lack global and temporally continuous coverage
  on tree mortality data. Ground-based observations on tree mortality, e.g., derived
  from national inventories, are very sparse, not standardized and not spatially explicit.
  Earth observation data, combined with supervised machine learning, offer a promising
  approach to map tree mortality over time. However, global-scale machine learning
  requires broad training data covering a wide range of environmental settings and
  forest types. Drones provide a cost-effective source of training data by capturing
  high-resolution orthophotos of tree mortality events at sub-centimeter resolution.
  Here, we introduce deadtrees.earth, an open-access platform hosting more than a
  thousand centimeter-resolution orthophotos, covering already more than 300,000 ha,
  of which more than 58,000 ha are fully annotated. This community-sourced and rigorously
  curated dataset shall serve as a foundation for a global initiative to gather comprehensive
  reference data. In concert with Earth observation data and machine learning it will
  serve to uncover tree mortality patterns from local to global scales. This will
  provide the foundation to attribute tree mortality patterns to environmental changes
  or project tree mortality dynamics to the future. Thus, the open and interactive
  nature of deadtrees.earth together with the collective effort of the community is
  meant to continuously increase our capacity to uncover and understand tree mortality
  patterns.
