 abstract = {Abstract Plant invasions can result in serious threats for
biodiversity and ecosystem functioning. Reliable maps at
very-high spatial resolution are needed to assess invasions
dynamics. Field sampling approaches could be replaced by
unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) to derive such maps. However,
pixel-based species classification at high spatial resolution is
highly affected by within-canopy variation caused by shadows.
Here, we studied the effect of shadows on mapping the occurrence
of invasive species using UAV-based data. MaxEnt one-class
classifications were applied to map Acacia dealbata, Ulex
europaeus and Pinus radiata in central-south Chile using
combinations of UAV-based spectral (RGB and hyperspectral), 2D
textural and 3D structural variables including and excluding
shaded canopy pixels during model calibration. The model
accuracies in terms of area under the curve (AUC), Cohen's
Kappa, sensitivity (true positive rate) and specificity (true
negative rate) were examined in sunlit and shaded canopies
separately. Bootstrapping was used for validation and to assess
statistical differences between models. Our results show that
shadows significantly affect the accuracies obtained with all
types of variables. The predictions in shaded areas were
generally inaccurate, leading to misclassification rates between
65% and 100% even when shadows were included during model
calibration. The exclusion of shaded areas from model
calibrations increased the predictive accuracies (especially in
terms of sensitivity), decreasing false positives. Spectral and
2D textural information showed generally higher performances and
improvements when excluding shadows from the analysis. Shadows
significantly affected the model results obtained with any of
the variables used, hence the exclusion of shadows is
recommended prior to model calibration. This relatively easy
pre-processing step enhances models for classifying species
occurrences using high-resolution spectral imagery and derived
products. Finally, a shadow simulation showed differences in the
ideal acquisition window for each species, which is important to
plan revisit campaigns.},
