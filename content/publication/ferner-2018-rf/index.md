abstract: Livestock rearing is the most important agricultural activity in global
  drylands, making forage supply an essential ecosystem service (ES). Most drylands
  are expected to experience increasing levels of climatic aridity and land-use pressure
  in the future. As few studies account for combined effects of these global change
  drivers, we still have a limited understanding of how these drivers jointly shape
  forage supply. Here, the concept of social-ecological systems (SESs) is useful,
  as it helps to formalize the complex interrelationships of drivers. Taking advantage
  of steep gradients of climatic aridity and land-use pressure in West Africa, a crossed
  space-for-time substitution was applied to capture combined effects of climate and
  land-use change on forage supply. We have operationalized the SES concept via structural
  equation modelling, and analysed how drivers directly or indirectly affected forage
  quantity, quality and their integrated proxy (metabolisable energy yield). Results
  demonstrate that contemporary dryland SESs are mainly controlled by land-use, which
  has often been used as a proxy for other variables, such as climatic aridity. Aridity
  was also directly linked to a higher risk of vegetation degradation, indicating
  that future drylands will be less resilient to grazing pressures. The importance
  of land-use drivers for ES provision implies that sustainable grazing management
  could potentially mitigate detrimental climate change effects. However, model effects
  mediated by intermediate variables, such as aridity, short-term vegetation dynamics,
  and weather fluctuations, make it extremely difficult to predict climate change
  effects on ESs. Integrating structural equation modelling into the well-defined
  SES concept is thus highly useful to disentangle complex interdependencies of global
  change drivers in dryland rangelands, and to analyze drivers' direct and indirect
  effects on ESs. Our novel approach can thus foster a deeper understanding of patterns
  and mechanisms driving ecosystem service supply in drylands, which is essential
  for establishing sustainable management under conditions of global change.
