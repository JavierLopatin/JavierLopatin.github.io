abstract: Invasive plant species can pose major threats to biodiversity, ecosystem
  functioning and services. Satellite based remote sensing has evolved as an important
  technology to spatially map the occurrence of invasive species in space and time.
  With the new era of the Sentinel missions, Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) and multispectral
  data are now freely available and repeatedly acquired on a high spatial and temporal
  resolution for the entire globe. However, the high potential of such sensors for
  automatic mapping procedures cannot be fully harnessed without sufficient and appropriate
  reference data for model calibration. Reference data are commonly acquired in field
  surveys, which however, are often relatively expensive and affected by sampling
  and observer bias. Moreover, a direct transferability to the remote sensing perspective
  and scale is difficult. Accordingly, we firstly assess the potential of Unmanned
  Aerial Vehicles (UAV) for semi-automatic reference data acquisition on species cover
  of three woody invasive species Pinus radiata, Ulex europaeus and Acacia dealbata
  occurring in Chile. Secondly, we test the upscaling of the estimated species cover
  to the spatial scale of Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2. The proposed workflow includes
  the visual sampling of respective canopies in UAV orthomosaics and the subsequent
  spatial extrapolations using MaxEnt with spectral (RGB, Hyperspectral), textural
  (2D) and canopy structural (3D) predictors derived from UAV-based photogrammetry.
  These UAV-based maps are then used to train random forest models with multitemporal
  Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 data to map the invasive species cover on large spatial
  scales. Our results show that the semi-automatic UAV-based mapping of the three
  invasive species results in accurate predictions. Depending on the predictor combination,
  the correlation was 0.70, 0.77 and 0.90 for Pinus radiatia, Ulex europaeus, Acacia
  dealbata, respectively. Among the three species, we observed clear differences in
  the model performance between the tested photogrammetric predictors and their combinations
  (spectral, 2D texture or 3D structure). For scaling up the UAV-based estimates to
  the satellite-scale, the Sentinel-2 data (multispectral) were more important than
  Sentinel-1 data (SAR). An independent validation revealed that the R2 of the upscaling
  accounted for 0.78 or higher for all species and RMSE lower than 12%. Our results
  hence demonstrate that UAV-based reference data acquisitions are a promising alternative
  to traditional field surveys if the target species are directly identifiable in
  the UAV data.
