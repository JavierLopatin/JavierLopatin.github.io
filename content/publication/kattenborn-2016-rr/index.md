abstract: The widely established CSR-model quantitatively groups plants according
  to their ecological response, i.e. competitiveness, stress-toleration and ruderality.
  These plant strategies are allocated using plant traits. We assess the potential
  of canopy traits derived by imaging spectroscopy and inverted radiative transfer
  models for allocating CSR-scores. Our findings indicate that plant traits (LAI,
  Cab, Car and SLA) are valuable `soft traits' to map plant strategies.
