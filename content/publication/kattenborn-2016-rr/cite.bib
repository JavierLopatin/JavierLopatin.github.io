 abstract = {The widely established CSR-model quantitatively groups plants
according to their ecological response, i.e. competitiveness,
stress-toleration and ruderality. These plant strategies are
allocated using plant traits. We assess the potential of canopy
traits derived by imaging spectroscopy and inverted radiative
transfer models for allocating CSR-scores. Our findings indicate
that plant traits (LAI, Cab, Car and SLA) are valuable `soft
traits' to map plant strategies.},
