abstract: 'Peatlands are ecosystems of great relevance, because they have an important
  number of ecological functions that provide many services to mankind. However, studies
  focusing on plant diversity, addressed from the remote sensing perspective, are
  still scarce in these environments. In the present study, predictions of vascular
  plant richness and diversity were performed in three anthropogenic peatlands on
  Chilo√© Island, Chile, using free satellite data from the sensors OLI, ASTER, and
  MSI. Also, we compared the suitability of these sensors using two modeling methods:
  random forest (RF) and the generalized linear model (GLM). As predictors for the
  empirical models, we used the spectral bands, vegetation indices and textural metrics.
  Variable importance was estimated using recursive feature elimination (RFE). Fourteen
  out of the 17 predictors chosen by RFE were textural metrics, demonstrating the
  importance of the spatial context to predict species richness and diversity. Non-significant
  differences were found between the algorithms; however, the GLM models often showed
  slightly better results than the RF. Predictions obtained by the different satellite
  sensors did not show significant differences; nevertheless, the best models were
  obtained with ASTER (richness: R2 = 0.62 and %RMSE = 17.2, diversity: R2 = 0.71
  and %RMSE = 20.2, obtained with RF and GLM respectively), followed by OLI and MSI.
  Diversity obtained higher accuracies than richness; nonetheless, accurate predictions
  were achieved for both, demonstrating the potential of free satellite data for the
  prediction of relevant community characteristics in anthropogenic peatland ecosystems.'
