 abstract = {Peatlands are ecosystems of great relevance, because they have
an important number of ecological functions that provide many
services to mankind. However, studies focusing on plant
diversity, addressed from the remote sensing perspective, are
still scarce in these environments. In the present study,
predictions of vascular plant richness and diversity were
performed in three anthropogenic peatlands on Chilo√© Island,
Chile, using free satellite data from the sensors OLI, ASTER,
and MSI. Also, we compared the suitability of these sensors
using two modeling methods: random forest (RF) and the
generalized linear model (GLM). As predictors for the empirical
models, we used the spectral bands, vegetation indices and
textural metrics. Variable importance was estimated using
recursive feature elimination (RFE). Fourteen out of the 17
predictors chosen by RFE were textural metrics, demonstrating
the importance of the spatial context to predict species
richness and diversity. Non-significant differences were found
between the algorithms; however, the GLM models often showed
slightly better results than the RF. Predictions obtained by the
different satellite sensors did not show significant
differences; nevertheless, the best models were obtained with
ASTER (richness: R2 = 0.62 and %RMSE = 17.2, diversity: R2 =
0.71 and %RMSE = 20.2, obtained with RF and GLM respectively),
followed by OLI and MSI. Diversity obtained higher accuracies
than richness; nonetheless, accurate predictions were achieved
for both, demonstrating the potential of free satellite data for
the prediction of relevant community characteristics in
anthropogenic peatland ecosystems.},
