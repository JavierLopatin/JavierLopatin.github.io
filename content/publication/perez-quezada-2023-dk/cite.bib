 abstract = {Successful restoration measures need a good understanding of how
the composition, structure, and functioning of ecosystems change
with degradation and what the best indicators of these changes
are. To answer these questions, we worked on four ecosystem types
in the Mediterranean Andes mountains in central Chile (from
sclerophyllous forest to Andean shrublands), which represent an
elevational gradient from 700 to 3,250 m. We sampled three plots
on each of the three degradation levels (low, medium, and high)
for each ecosystem at increasing distances from goat corrals. We
measured 35 indicators that describe vegetation (14), soil (15),
and ecosystem processes (6) for one growing season. Degradation
caused a decrease in shrub cover, shrub productivity, the
Normalized Community Structure Integrity Index (CSIIn), litter
depth, total soil nitrogen and C/N ratio, and an increase in clay
content. Plant species indicating low degradation were
consistently native woody species. When comparing ecosystems
(i.e., at different elevations) against the type of variable,
process-based indicators showed more statistically significant
differences. Based on their consistency across ecosystems and
ease of measurement, we recommend using shrub cover and litter
depth as indicators of degradation. Finally, we concluded that
ecosystems are highly degraded when vegetation- and process-based
indicators change ∼ 60% or when soil indicators change ∼ 25%.
These results could also be used to set goals for restoration
projects in these mountain ecosystems.},
