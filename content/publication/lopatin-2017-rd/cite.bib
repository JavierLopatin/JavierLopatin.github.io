 abstract = {Grasslands are one of the ecosystems that have been strongly
affected by anthropogenic impacts. The state-of-the-art in
monitoring changes in grassland species composition is to
conduct repeated plot-based vegetation surveys that assess the
occurrence and cover of plants. These plot-based surveys are
typically limited to comparably small areas and the quality of
the cover estimates depends strongly on the experience and
performance of the surveyors. Here, we investigate the
possibility of a semi-automated, image-based method for cover
estimates, by analyzing the applicability of very high spatial
resolution hyperspectral data to classify grassland species at
the level of individuals. This individual-oriented approach is
seen as an alternative to community-oriented remote sensing
depicting canopy reflectance as the total of mixed species
reflectance. An AISA+ imaging spectrometer mounted on a scaffold
was used to scan 1m2 grassland plots and assess the impact of
four sources of variation on the predicted species cover: (1)
the spatial resolution of the scans, (2) complexity, i.e.
species number and structural diversity, (3) the species cover
and (4) the share of functional types (graminoids and forbs).
Classifications were conducted using a support vector machine
classification with a linear kernel, obtaining a median Kappa of
~0.8. Species cover estimations reached median r2 and root mean
square errors (RMSE) of ~0.6 and ~6.2% respectively. We found
that the spatial resolution and diversity level (mainly
structural diversity) were the most important sources of
variation affecting the performance of the proposed approach. A
spatial resolution below 1cm produced relatively good models for
estimating species-specific coverages (r2=~0.6; RMSE=~7.5%)
while predictions using pixel sizes over that threshold failed
in this individual-oriented approach (r2=~0.17; RMSE=~20.7%).
Areas with low inter-species overlap were better suited than
areas with frequent inter-species overlap. We conclude that the
application of very high resolution hyperspectral remote sensing
in environments with low structural heterogeneity is suited for
individual-oriented mapping of grassland plant species.},
