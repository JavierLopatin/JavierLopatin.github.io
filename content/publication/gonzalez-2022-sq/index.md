abstract: Nothofagus alessandrii, categorized as Endangered on the IUCN Red List,
  is an endemic, deciduous tree species of the coastal range of central Chile. We
  assessed the effects of fire severity, invasion by the exotic fire-prone Pinus radiata,
  and land-cover composition and configuration of the landscape on the resilience
  of fragments of N. alessandrii after a mega-fire in 2017. We used remote sensing
  data to estimate land-use classes and cover, fire severity and invasion cover of
  P. radiata. We monitored forest composition and structure and post-fire responses
  of N. alessandrii forests in situ for 2 years after the mega-fire. In the coastal
  Maule region wildfires have been favoured by intense drought and widespread exotic
  pine plantations, increasing the ability of fire-adapted invasive species to colonize
  native forest remnants. Over 85% of N. alessandrii forests were moderately or severely
  burnt. The propagation and severity of fire was probably amplified by the exotic
  pines located along the edges of, or inside, the N. alessandrii fragments and the
  highly flammable pine plantations surrounding these fragments (> 60% of land use
  is pine plantations). Pinus radiata, a fire-adapted pioneer species, showed strong
  post-fire recruitment within the N. alessandrii fragments, especially those severely
  burnt. Positive feedback between climate change (i.e. droughts and heat waves),
  wildfires and pine invasions is driving N. alessandrii forests into an undesirable
  and probably irreversible state (i.e. a landscape trap). A large-scale restoration
  programme to design a diverse and less flammable landscape is needed to avoid the
  loss of these highly threatened forest ecosystems.
