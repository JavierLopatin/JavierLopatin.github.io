 abstract = {Peatlands are key reservoirs of belowground carbon (C) and their
monitoring is important to assess the rapid changes in the C
cycle caused by climate change and direct anthropogenic impacts.
Frequently, information of peatland area and vegetation type
estimated by remote sensing has been used along with soil
measurements and allometric functions to estimate belowground C
stocks. Despite the accuracy of such approaches, there is still
the need to find mappable proxies that enhance predictions with
remote sensing data while reducing field and laboratory efforts.
Therefore, we assessed the use of aboveground vegetation
attributes as proxies to predict peatland belowground C stocks.
First, the ecological relations between remotely detectable
vegetation attributes (i.e. vegetation height, aboveground
biomass, species richness and floristic composition of vascular
plants) and belowground C stocks were obtained using structural
equation modeling (SEM). SEM was formulated using expert
knowledge and trained and validated using in-situ information.
Second, the SEM latent vectors were spatially mapped using
random forests regressions with UAV-based hyperspectral and
structural information. Finally, this enabled us to map
belowground C stocks using the SEM functions parameterized with
the random forests derived maps. This SEM approach resulted in
higher accuracies than a direct application of a purely
data-driven random forests approach with UAV data, with
improvements of r2 from 0.39 to 0.54, normalized RMSE from
31.33% to 20.24% and bias from âˆ’0.73 to 0.05. Our case study
showed that: (1) vegetation height, species richness and
aboveground biomass are good proxies to map peatland belowground
C stocks, as they can be estimated using remote sensing data and
hold strong relationships with the belowground C gradient; and
(2) SEM is facilitates to incorporate theoretical knowledge in
empirical modeling approaches.},
