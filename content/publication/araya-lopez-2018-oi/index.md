abstract: In the Maipo watershed, situated in central Chile, mining activities are
  impacting high altitude Andean wetlands through the consumption and exploitation
  of water and land. As wetlands are vulnerable and particularly susceptible to changes
  of water supply, alterations and modifications in the hydrological regime have direct
  effects on their ecophysiological condition and vegetation cover. The aim of this
  study was to evaluate the potential of Worldview-2 and Sentinel-2 sensors to identify
  and map Andean wetlands through the use of the one-class classifier Bias support
  vector machines (BSVM), and then to estimate soil moisture content of the identified
  wetlands during snow-free summer using partial least square regression. The results
  obtained in this research showed that the combination of remote sensing data and
  a small sample of ground reference measurements enables to map Andean high altitude
  wetlands with high accuracies. BSVM was capable to classify the meadow areas with
  an overall accuracy of over ∼78% for both sensors. Our results also indicate that
  it is feasible to map surface soil moisture with optical remote sensing data and
  simple regression approaches in the examined environment. Surface soil moisture
  estimates reached r2 values of up to 0.58, and normalized mean square errors of
  19% using Sentinel-2 data, while Worldview-2 estimates resulted in non-satisfying
  results. The presented approach is particularly valuable for monitoring high-mountain
  wetland areas with limited accessibility such as in the Andes.
