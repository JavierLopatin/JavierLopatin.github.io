Rocío has a background in Agricultural Science and completed a Master in Nature Conservation at the University of Chile, Chile. Through her studies, she has developed strong field, laboratory, and data analysis skills. Her research experience combines using remote sensing data, geographic information systems (GIS), and spatial analysis in High Andean Wetlands and Peatlands. Currently, her research is directed towards capitalizing on Blue Carbon. We have the scientific knowledge on how significant Blue Carbon ecosystems are to mitigate climate change. However, the growing interest and demand for carbon offsets from natural climate solutions represents a great opportunity to connect new partners to support the conservation and restoration of these systems.
