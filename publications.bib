              indicator in understanding the behavior of ecosystems and how

              interannual variations of remotely sensed phenology signals to
              differentiate plant types remains poorly understood, especially
              in understudied systems with highly heterogeneous landscapes such
              as wetlands. This study presents a case study in a San Francisco
              Bay area marsh that investigates the usefulness of interannual
              variation, defined as the root-mean-square error of enhanced

              curve, at the beginning, middle, and end of the growing season as

              day-of-the-year of the end of the season, the mid-autumn day, and
              the greening rate before the summer peak, were significantly

              in the Mediterranean Andes mountains in central Chile (from
              sclerophyllous forest to Andean shrublands), which represent an
              elevational gradient from 700 to 3,250 m. We sampled three plots
              on each of the three degradation levels (low, medium, and high)

              measured 35 indicators that describe vegetation (14), soil (15),
              and ecosystem processes (6) for one growing season. Degradation
              caused a decrease in shrub cover, shrub productivity, the

              ease of measurement, we recommend using shrub cover and litter
              depth as indicators of degradation. Finally, we concluded that
              ecosystems are highly degraded when vegetation- and process-based
              indicators change ∼ 60\% or when soil indicators change ∼ 25\%.

               models, we used the spectral bands, vegetation indices and
               textural metrics. Variable importance was estimated using
               recursive feature elimination (RFE). Fourteen out of the 17

               global drylands, making forage supply an essential ecosystem
               service (ES). Most drylands are expected to experience
               increasing levels of climatic aridity and land-use pressure in
               the future. As few studies account for combined effects of these
               global change drivers, we still have a limited understanding of
               how these drivers jointly shape forage supply. Here, the concept
               of social-ecological systems (SESs) is useful, as it helps to
               formalize the complex interrelationships of drivers. Taking
               advantage of steep gradients of climatic aridity and land-use
               pressure in West Africa, a crossed space-for-time substitution
               was applied to capture combined effects of climate and land-use
               change on forage supply. We have operationalized the SES concept
               via structural equation modelling, and analysed how drivers
               directly or indirectly affected forage quantity, quality and
               their integrated proxy (metabolisable energy yield). Results
               demonstrate that contemporary dryland SESs are mainly controlled
               by land-use, which has often been used as a proxy for other
               variables, such as climatic aridity. Aridity was also directly
               linked to a higher risk of vegetation degradation, indicating
               that future drylands will be less resilient to grazing
               pressures. The importance of land-use drivers for ES provision
               implies that sustainable grazing management could potentially
               mitigate detrimental climate change effects. However, model
               effects mediated by intermediate variables, such as aridity,
               short-term vegetation dynamics, and weather fluctuations, make
               it extremely difficult to predict climate change effects on ESs.
               Integrating structural equation modelling into the well-defined
               SES concept is thus highly useful to disentangle complex
               interdependencies of global change drivers in dryland
               rangelands, and to analyze drivers' direct and indirect effects
               on ESs. Our novel approach can thus foster a deeper
               understanding of patterns and mechanisms driving ecosystem
               service supply in drylands, which is essential for establishing
               sustainable management under conditions of global change.",

               Location A raised bog and minerotrophic fen complex, Murnauer
               Moos, Germany. Methods Spatial distributions of plant traits
               were modelled by adopting an inversion of the PROSAIL radiative
               transfer model on airborne hyperspectral imagery. The traits are
               derived from reflectance without making use of field data but
               only of known links between reflectance and traits. We tested
               whether previously found patterns in CSR plant strategies were
               related to the modelled traits. Results The results confirm
               close relationships between modelled plant traits and C, S and R
               strategies that were previously found in the field. The modelled
               plant traits explained different dimensions of the CSR-space.
               Leaf Area Index (LAI) and the reciprocal of Specific Leaf Area
               appeared to be good candidates for reproducing CSR scores as
               community traits using remote sensing. LAI has not been used in
               previous studies to allocate plant strategies. Conclusions
               Combining RTMs and the CSR model is a promising approach for
               establishing a robust link between airborne or spaceborne
               imagery and plant functioning. The demonstrated potential to map
               traits with close relation to CSR gradients using only our
               understanding of the relation between traits and reflectance is
               a step forward towards an operational use of the CSR model in
               remote sensing. This article is protected by copyright. All

               conservation of biodiversity in a quickly changing world is a
               challenging task which requires cost-efficient and precise
               monitoring systems. In the present study, the suitability of
               airborne discrete-return LiDAR data for the mapping of vascular
               plant species richness within a Sub-Mediterranean second growth
               native forest ecosystem was examined. The vascular plant
               richness of four different layers (total, tree, shrub and herb
               richness) was modeled using twelve LiDAR-derived variables. As
               species richness values are typically count data, the
               corresponding asymmetry and heteroscedasticity in the error
               distribution has to be considered. In this context, we compared
               the suitability of random forest (RF) and a Generalized Linear
               Model (GLM) with a negative binomial error distribution. Both
               models were coupled with a feature selection approach to
               identify the most relevant LiDAR predictors and keep the models
               parsimonious. The results of RF and GLM agreed that the three
               most important predictors for all four layers were altitude
               above sea level, standard deviation of slope and mean canopy
               height. This was consistent with the preconception of LiDAR's
               suitability for estimating species richness, which is its
               capacity to capture three types of information:
               micro-topographical, macro-topographical and canopy structural.
               Generalized Linear Models showed higher performances (r2: 0.66,
               0.50, 0.52, 0.50; nRMSE: 16.29\%, 19.08\%, 17.89\%, 21.31\% for
               total, tree, shrub and herb richness respectively) than RF (r2:
               0.55, 0.33, 0.45, 0.46; nRMSE: 18.30\%, 21.90\%, 18.95\%,
               21.00\% for total, tree, shrub and herb richness, respectively).
               Furthermore, the results of the best GLM were more parsimonious
               (three predictors) and less biased than the best RF models
               (twelve predictors). We think that this is due to the mentioned
               non-symmetric error distribution of the species richness values,
               which RF is unable to properly capture. From an ecological
               perspective, the predicted patterns agreed well with the known
               vegetation composition of the area. We found especially high
               species numbers at low elevations and along riversides. In these
               areas, overlapping distributions of thermopile sclerophyllos
               species, water demanding Valdivian evergreen species and species
               growing in Nothofagus obliqua forests occur. The three main
               conclusions of the study are: 1) appropriate model selection is
               crucial when working with biodiversity count data; 2) the
               application of RF for data with non-symmetric error
               distributions is questionable; and 3) structural and topographic

               affected by anthropogenic impacts. The state-of-the-art in
               monitoring changes in grassland species composition is to
               conduct repeated plot-based vegetation surveys that assess the
               occurrence and cover of plants. These plot-based surveys are
               typically limited to comparably small areas and the quality of
               the cover estimates depends strongly on the experience and
               performance of the surveyors. Here, we investigate the
               possibility of a semi-automated, image-based method for cover
               estimates, by analyzing the applicability of very high spatial
               resolution hyperspectral data to classify grassland species at
               the level of individuals. This individual-oriented approach is
               seen as an alternative to community-oriented remote sensing
               depicting canopy reflectance as the total of mixed species
               reflectance. An AISA+ imaging spectrometer mounted on a scaffold
               was used to scan 1m2 grassland plots and assess the impact of
               four sources of variation on the predicted species cover: (1)
               the spatial resolution of the scans, (2) complexity, i.e.
               species number and structural diversity, (3) the species cover
               and (4) the share of functional types (graminoids and forbs).
               Classifications were conducted using a support vector machine
               classification with a linear kernel, obtaining a median Kappa of
               ~0.8. Species cover estimations reached median r2 and root mean
               square errors (RMSE) of ~0.6 and ~6.2\% respectively. We found
               that the spatial resolution and diversity level (mainly
               structural diversity) were the most important sources of
               variation affecting the performance of the proposed approach. A
               spatial resolution below 1cm produced relatively good models for
               estimating species-specific coverages (r2=~0.6; RMSE=~7.5\%)
               while predictions using pixel sizes over that threshold failed
               in this individual-oriented approach (r2=~0.17; RMSE=~20.7\%).
               Areas with low inter-species overlap were better suited than
               areas with frequent inter-species overlap. We conclude that the
               application of very high resolution hyperspectral remote sensing
               in environments with low structural heterogeneity is suited for
               individual-oriented mapping of grassland plant species.",

               monitoring is important to assess the rapid changes in the C
               cycle caused by climate change and direct anthropogenic impacts.
               Frequently, information of peatland area and vegetation type
               estimated by remote sensing has been used along with soil
               measurements and allometric functions to estimate belowground C
               stocks. Despite the accuracy of such approaches, there is still
               the need to find mappable proxies that enhance predictions with
               remote sensing data while reducing field and laboratory efforts.
               Therefore, we assessed the use of aboveground vegetation
               attributes as proxies to predict peatland belowground C stocks.
               First, the ecological relations between remotely detectable
               vegetation attributes (i.e. vegetation height, aboveground
               biomass, species richness and floristic composition of vascular
               plants) and belowground C stocks were obtained using structural
               equation modeling (SEM). SEM was formulated using expert
               knowledge and trained and validated using in-situ information.
               Second, the SEM latent vectors were spatially mapped using
               random forests regressions with UAV-based hyperspectral and
               structural information. Finally, this enabled us to map
               belowground C stocks using the SEM functions parameterized with
               the random forests derived maps. This SEM approach resulted in
               higher accuracies than a direct application of a purely
               data-driven random forests approach with UAV data, with
               improvements of r2 from 0.39 to 0.54, normalized RMSE from
               31.33\% to 20.24\% and bias from −0.73 to 0.05. Our case study
               showed that: (1) vegetation height, species richness and
               aboveground biomass are good proxies to map peatland belowground
               C stocks, as they can be estimated using remote sensing data and
               hold strong relationships with the belowground C gradient; and

               sensing has evolved as an important technology to spatially map
               the occurrence of invasive species in space and time. With the
               new era of the Sentinel missions, Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR)
               and multispectral data are now freely available and repeatedly
               acquired on a high spatial and temporal resolution for the
               entire globe. However, the high potential of such sensors for
               automatic mapping procedures cannot be fully harnessed without
               sufficient and appropriate reference data for model calibration.
               Reference data are commonly acquired in field surveys, which
               however, are often relatively expensive and affected by sampling
               and observer bias. Moreover, a direct transferability to the
               remote sensing perspective and scale is difficult. Accordingly,
               we firstly assess the potential of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles
               (UAV) for semi-automatic reference data acquisition on species
               cover of three woody invasive species Pinus radiata, Ulex
               europaeus and Acacia dealbata occurring in Chile. Secondly, we
               test the upscaling of the estimated species cover to the spatial
               scale of Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2. The proposed workflow
               includes the visual sampling of respective canopies in UAV
               orthomosaics and the subsequent spatial extrapolations using
               MaxEnt with spectral (RGB, Hyperspectral), textural (2D) and
               canopy structural (3D) predictors derived from UAV-based
               photogrammetry. These UAV-based maps are then used to train
               random forest models with multitemporal Sentinel-1 and
               Sentinel-2 data to map the invasive species cover on large
               spatial scales. Our results show that the semi-automatic
               UAV-based mapping of the three invasive species results in
               accurate predictions. Depending on the predictor combination,
               the correlation was 0.70, 0.77 and 0.90 for Pinus radiatia, Ulex
               europaeus, Acacia dealbata, respectively. Among the three
               species, we observed clear differences in the model performance
               between the tested photogrammetric predictors and their
               combinations (spectral, 2D texture or 3D structure). For scaling
               up the UAV-based estimates to the satellite-scale, the
               Sentinel-2 data (multispectral) were more important than
               Sentinel-1 data (SAR). An independent validation revealed that
               the R2 of the upscaling accounted for 0.78 or higher for all
               species and RMSE lower than 12\%. Our results hence demonstrate
               that UAV-based reference data acquisitions are a promising
               alternative to traditional field surveys if the target species
               are directly identifiable in the UAV data.",

               biodiversity and ecosystem functioning. Reliable maps at
               very-high spatial resolution are needed to assess invasions
               dynamics. Field sampling approaches could be replaced by
               unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) to derive such maps. However,
               pixel-based species classification at high spatial resolution is
               highly affected by within-canopy variation caused by shadows.
               Here, we studied the effect of shadows on mapping the occurrence
               of invasive species using UAV-based data. MaxEnt one-class
               classifications were applied to map Acacia dealbata, Ulex
               europaeus and Pinus radiata in central-south Chile using
               combinations of UAV-based spectral (RGB and hyperspectral), 2D
               textural and 3D structural variables including and excluding
               shaded canopy pixels during model calibration. The model
               accuracies in terms of area under the curve (AUC), Cohen's
               Kappa, sensitivity (true positive rate) and specificity (true
               negative rate) were examined in sunlit and shaded canopies
               separately. Bootstrapping was used for validation and to assess
               statistical differences between models. Our results show that
               shadows significantly affect the accuracies obtained with all
               types of variables. The predictions in shaded areas were
               generally inaccurate, leading to misclassification rates between
               65\% and 100\% even when shadows were included during model
               calibration. The exclusion of shaded areas from model
               calibrations increased the predictive accuracies (especially in
               terms of sensitivity), decreasing false positives. Spectral and
               2D textural information showed generally higher performances and
               improvements when excluding shadows from the analysis. Shadows
               significantly affected the model results obtained with any of
               the variables used, hence the exclusion of shadows is
               recommended prior to model calibration. This relatively easy
               pre-processing step enhances models for classifying species
               occurrences using high-resolution spectral imagery and derived
